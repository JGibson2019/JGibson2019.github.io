title: Some of the talks I've given

One of the best ways to advocate for the subjects I'm passionate about is by giving a talk (or two)! While I'm still new to the conference circuit, here are some of the talks I've given grouped by the topics they relate to:

## Race and Technology
### For Us, Without Us: Addressing Tech's Shortcomings in Creating Equity for Black People
Presented this at the 2020 Juneteenth Conference. I 
discussed the ways that anti-Blackness is replicated in technology, the discrepancies faced by Black communities due to the digital divide, and the changes required for us to have a more equitable future.
